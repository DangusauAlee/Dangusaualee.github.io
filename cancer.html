								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/confusion matrix.png" alt="" /></a>
								<header>
									<h3>Insights</h3>
									
								</header>
								<p>
									The accuracy of the model being 0.9082 indicates that it performs well in predicting patient priority across the entire dataset. However, given the high class imbalance and the critical nature of the model, focusing on specific metrics like False Positives (FP) becomes crucial to ensure that high-priority patients receive the appropriate attention. 
									<br/>Let's interpret the confusion matrix and its implications:

<h5>Confusion Matrix:</h5>

    True Negatives (TN): 51
   <br/> False Positives (FP): 49
   <br/>False Negatives (FN): 10
   <br/>True Positives (TP): 620

<h5>Interpretation:</h5>

    True Negatives (TN): The model correctly predicted 51 instances as low priority.
    <br/>False Positives (FP): The model incorrectly predicted 49 instances as high priority when they were actually low priority. This is a critical concern since it may result in low-priority patients receiving unnecessary urgent attention.
    <br/>False Negatives (FN): The model incorrectly predicted 10 instances as low priority when they were actually high priority. This is also a concern as it means some high-priority patients were not properly identified.
    <br/>True Positives (TP): The model correctly predicted 620 instances as high priority.
								</p>
								<p>
									In summary, while the model's accuracy is commendable, the challenge lies in optimizing the balance between high precision and recall, particularly with a focus on minimizing False Positives. Addressing the class imbalance and refining the model's thresholds or techniques might lead to a more balanced outcome that prioritizes patient care effectively while reducing the risk of unnecessary interventions for low-priority patients.
									Also its not a problem a probel if low priority patients are placed on high priority. its not a risk either to the parient nor to the hospital thus the False Positive Rate wasnt given much attention, infact it was used as a trade-off to achieve lower False Negative Rate as this metric is very important for the system.

									<h3>Insights</h3>
									
								</header>
								<p>
									The learning curve provides important insights into how the model's accuracy changes with different amounts of training data and its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
									<br/>Here's what these observations imply:

   <br/> Overfitting and Generalization: The initial high training accuracy suggests that the model may initially be overfitting the small dataset. As the dataset grows, the model generalizes better, leading to a slight decrease in training accuracy and an increase in cross-validation accuracy. This behavior is indicative of a well-balanced model that avoids overfitting.

   <br/>  Data Size and Generalization: The convergence of the training and cross-validation curves suggests that increasing the dataset size has led to improved generalization performance. This indicates that the model benefits from a larger and more diverse dataset to learn from.

   <br/> Stability and Variability: The lower standard deviation in the training accuracy indicates that the model's performance on the training data is more stable and less sensitive to changes in the dataset. On the other hand, the higher standard deviation in the cross-validation score suggests that the model's performance on unseen data may vary more.
								</p>
								<p>

									In summary, the "Learning Curve" visualization indicates that the model achieves strong accuracy and stable performance with a larger dataset, suggesting that it can effectively prioritize patient appointments based on the input features. Regular monitoring and continuous improvement efforts can contribute to further enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
